hg-prompt
=========

hg-prompt is an extension for Mercurial which adds an 'hg prompt' command for putting repository information into a shell prompt efficiently.

Installing
----------

Clone the repository:

    $ hg clone hg clone https://sjl@bitbucket.org/sjl/hg-prompt/

Edit the `[extensions]` section in your `~/.hgrc` file:

    [extensions]
    prompt = (path to)/hg-prompt/prompt.py

Using the Command
-----------------

The `hg prompt` command takes a single string as an argument and outputs it.  A simple (and useless) example:

    $ hg prompt "test"
    test

Keywords in curly braces can be used to output repository information:

    $ hg prompt "currently on {branch}"
    currently on default

Keywords also have an extended form:

    {optional text{branch}more optional text}

This form will output the text and the expanded keyword **only** if the keyword successfully expands.  This can be useful for displaying extra text only if it's applicable:

    $ hg prompt "currently on {branch} and at {bookmark}"
    currently on branch default and at 
    
    $ hg prompt "currently on {branch} {and at {bookmark}}"
    currently on branch default 
    
    $ hg bookmark my-book
    
    $ hg prompt "currently on {branch} {and at {bookmark}}"
    currently on branch default and at my-book

Available Keywords
------------------

There are only a few keywords at the moment (mostly the ones I want for myself).  If you have any suggestions for more please let me know.

* bookmark: the current bookmark
* branch: the current branch
* status:
  * `!` if the repository has any changed, added, removed or deleted files, otherwise
  * `?` if the repository has any untracked (but not ignored) files, otherwise
  * nothing
